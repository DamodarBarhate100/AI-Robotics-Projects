### *Bridging the Gap Between Embedded Systems, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning*

Welcome to my personal research repository. I am a **3rd-year Computer Science Undergraduate** focused on the intersection of hardware control and intelligent algorithms.

The goal of this lab is to move beyond simple automation and create systems that can perceive and reason about the physical world. My current research focuses on **robust sensor fusion**, **signal processing**, and the application of **Machine Learning** to embedded environments.

## Project Portfolio

| Project Name | Status | Domain | Technical Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[01-Intelligent Obstacle Detection and_Ranging System](https://www.google.com/search?q=./01-Ultrasonic-Radar)** |  Completed | *Embedded Systems / Signals* | Solved "specular reflection" and acoustic crosstalk issues using statistical filtering (Median Filter) and a split-rail power architecture for noise isolation. |
| **Micro-Doppler Classification** | Research Phase | *Deep Learning / RF Sensing* | Investigating the use of Machine Learning to classify target types based on micro-motion frequency signatures (Doppler effect) rather than just distance. |
